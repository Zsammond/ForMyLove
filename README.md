Good morning, dear professors!

Thanks for giving me the opportunity for this interview. My name is WangTingting, 22 years old, and I come from XingYi of GuiZhou province, a beautiful city. I graduated from the foreign language college of ShanDong university of Science and Technology in July, 2021. And I double majored in Korean and Law. Now I will introduce myself from the following three aspects: my academic performance, practical experience and future plans.

Firstly, during my university, I have learnt some basic knowledge of law. The topic of my graduation thesis is" Research on Criminal Regulations of Internet Violence". At the same time, I can speak Korean fluently and I passed CET-6 and TKM-4 test, which, I think will help me a lot in my future study and research.

Secondly, I had a one-month internship in Guizhou Yongqing Law Firm in August 2018. The experience gave me some idea of how the law works in real life and I felt the authority of the law and strengthened my faith in the law.

Lastly, the systematic study of law in university makes me more and more interested in law, and I enjoy the process of using law to think and solve problems, so I want to further study. I would spare no effort to study my major well and improve myself if have a chance for further study.
That's all, thanks for your attention!

This repository for my love.
